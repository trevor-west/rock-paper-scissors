1. UNDERSTAND:

First I will understand the instructions in the first main step from the project page (step 3 in https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors):
"Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!""

So I need to make a function called getComputerChoice that returns randomly 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors

2. PLAN
- No graphical interface is needed -- this will all be done in the console
- I could use Math.Random to associate 33% interval with each of the 3 values ('Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors') and then use conditionals and boolean checks to return accordingly (randomly).
